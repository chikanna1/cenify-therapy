Then in my adulthood, I suffered through another traumatic event that sent me to the dark night of the soul. Through that healing journey I realized everything is connected and in order for me to heal, I had to evaluate what I was eating, how I was moving my body, who I was interacting with, and add in a mindfulness practice. From this experience, I created the Holistic Approach which I apply with clients today and have much success in changing their lives"
